**New Year, New Goals: Reflecting on the Past and Planning for the Future**

As the new year dawns, it's a time-honored tradition to pen down our plans and reflect on the year that has passed. It's a moment to pause, take a deep breath, and contemplate.

**Looking Back on the Past Year**

In the year gone by, I've accomplished quite a few things:

1. I served as a teaching assistant for courses such as "Data Structure and Algorithm" and "Computer Programming A." Additionally, I briefly acted as a teaching assistant for "Mathematical Analysis B1" (Janurary in 2024), which is also worth considering.

2. I embarked on a scientific research journey as a junior research assistant at CUHK. Although my contributions were modest, I discovered a deep passion for research and have decided to dedicate the rest of my life to it.

3. I met many new people and forged friendships with them.

4. I received a Ph.D. offer from CityUHK, specializing in AI. My advisor, Jinhang Zuo, is a wonderful person, and I look forward to studying and researching with him over the next four years.

5. I acquired a wealth of new knowledge and honed several new skills.

However, I also realized that I've spent an excessive amount of time on computer games. I am resolved to cut down on gaming and refocus my efforts on my studies.

**Embracing the Future with Enthusiasm**

With a soul ablaze with passion, I am innately driven to surpass my limits, disdainful of the constraints of traditional boundaries, and captivated by the allure of distant fragrances. In 2025, I am set to journey to Hong Kong to complete my Ph.D. Now, I am poised to set several goals for myself:

1. Publish a research paper.

2. Explore a new destination.

3. Maintain a regular blogging habit.

4. Speak English fluently and communicate effectively with others.

5. Achieve recognition through awards.

6. Engage in impactful projects.

7. Read some new books.

8. Keep fit.

I am committed to persisting in scientific research, contributing to my dreams, and the construction of my homeland.
